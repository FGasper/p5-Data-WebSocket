0.03
- BREAKING: Endpoint now defers non-blocking writes to a queue.
  Non-blocking implementations will need to account for writability
  of the write filehandle and process the queue as needed.

- Refactor ping handling behavior into its own module. It could be
  reusable potentially?

- EINTR-trapping logic is now distributed separatedly as IO::SigGuard.
