Revision history for Perl module Net::WebSocket

0.01 Wed Mar 22 2017
- Initial release

0.02 Thu Mar 23 2017
- Add this Changes file. :)

- BREAKING: Rename Endpoint “timeout” method to “check_heartbeat”.

- Fix missing Call::Context dependency.


0.03
- BREAKING: Endpoint now defers non-blocking writes to a queue.
  Non-blocking implementations will need to account for writability
  of the write filehandle and process the queue as needed.

- Refactor ping handling behavior into its own module. It could be
  reusable for Net::WAMP’s RawSocket support … though potentially not
  if the WAMP specification clarifies a different behavior pattern
  for its RawSocket ping/pong. :-/
